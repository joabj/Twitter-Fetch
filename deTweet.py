#This program will take a Twitter user timeline, as returned by the Twitter API (from the Fetch.py program), and format
#the text, time, location, and Tweet ID. In this case for printing onto the screen, but can be piped elsewhere.
#Eventually optional attributes, such as a photos, will also be included. 
#
#Running from the command line, the program needs the name of the .json file where the timeline has been stored (by Fetch.py
#in my own setup) i.e. "deTweet.py 170602.json")
#
#Also, this program captues, and writes to a text file the ID of the last Tweet, which will be useful for fetching new data only
#since the last date. This may be moved somewhere else eventually.
